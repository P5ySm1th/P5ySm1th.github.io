## Scan Surprise

{{< notice note >}}
I've gotten bored of handing out flags as text. Wouldn't it be cool if they were an image instead?

## Verify

{{< notice note >}}
People keep trying to trick my players with imitation flags. I want to make sure they get the real thing! I'm going to provide the SHA-256 hash and a decrypt script to help you know that my flags are legitimate.

## Secret of the Polyglot
{{< notice note >}}
The Network Operations Center (NOC) of your local institution picked up a suspicious file, they're getting conflicting information on what type of file it is. They've brought you in as an external expert to examine the file. Can you extract all the information from this strange file?

## endianness-v2
{{< notice note >}}
Here's a file that was recovered from a 32-bits system that organized the bytes a weird way. We're not even sure what type of file it is.

## Blast from the past
{{< notice note >}}
The judge for these pictures is a real fan of antiques. Can you age this photo to the specifications? Set the timestamps on this picture to 1970:01:01 00:00:00.001+00:00 with as much precision as possible for each timestamp. In this example, +00:00 is a timezone adjustment. Any timezone is acceptable as long as the time is equivalent. As an example, this timestamp is acceptable as well: 1969:12:31 19:00:00.001-05:00. For timestamps without a timezone adjustment, put them in GMT time (+00:00). The checker program provides the timestamp needed for each.

If you can find the flag on this disk image, we can close the case for good!
